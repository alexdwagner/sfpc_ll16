# Introduction to Lingua Lucis at SFPC

Graphic Processing Units have a special language of their own. Based on C syntax, GLSL Language is designed to modify the render pipeline on openGL, lending us full power over the color light of each pixel on the screen. In this course will learn the fine art of using this language in an expressive way. 

For this [*artem dicendi lingua lucis*](https://translate.google.com/#la/en/artem%20dicendi%20lingua%20lucis) we will work with the following tools and resources:

- [The Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com/)
- [The Book's web GLSL Editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/)
- [The Book's native GLSL Viewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer)
- [OpenFrame.io](http://openframe.io/) running on a [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

Then you can apply this knowledge on any other platform/framework you prefer, for example:

- [Three.js](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/thebookofshaders/tree/master/04/three_js)
- [OpenFramework](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/thebookofshaders/tree/master/04/openFrameworks)
- [Processing](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/thebookofshaders/tree/master/04/processing)
